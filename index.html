            <p>Hi! I'm Jeremy. I'm from Cupertino, CA. I'm in the class of 2020 at Duke, studying Computer Science.</p>

            <h2>CS Bio</h2>
            <p> I started using a computer around when I was 4 or 5 years old. It was one of those ancient ThinkPads my parents used for work.
                I've used many types of computers, on most major operating systems. (Pocket PCs, phones, laptops, custom desktops, Raspberry Pi's, etc.)I use computers for productivity, gaming, messaging, and pretty much everything else on a daily basis.
                I think a computer scientist designs and builds features for software on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>
                My introductory programming course I took in high school had a game design project using Java Swing/Applets, and I think the experience of building that terrible game was something that led me to study computer science. I'm taking this course because my friend told me to register 15 minutes before class started and because I thought web development might be a useful skill.
            </p>
            <p>
                For front-end, some experience with UI/UX design and knowledge of HTML/CSS would be helpful in building attractive and user-friendly interfaces. For back-end, knowing a language like JS or Python and an understanding of how databases work would be useful.
                Since I'm planning on being a software engineer after graduating, I see myself using computers a lot more for coding and other work-related tasks in the future.

            <h2>Some Websites</h2>
            <h3>Two Good Ones</h3>
            <p><a href="http://floot.io" title="floot">floot.io</a>: This is a good website because of its simplicity and the somewhat haphazard typeface, which is cohesive with its simple and humorous purpose. It's very simple to navigate the website, and it is very clear what the user can do on the site.</p>
            <p><a href="http://getpostman.com" title="postman">getpostman.com</a>: This is a good website because it has a wonderful color scheme and a very clear and easily navigatable layout. It manages to look great while still providing a lot of utility and information.</p>
            <h3>Two Bad Ones</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.theroommovie.com/" title="theroommovie">theroommovie.com</a>: This is a bad website because it has no real logic to its layout and is difficult to navigate. It also has a fairly ugly color scheme and small text. Also the map on the website is not interactive, and is simply a screenshot from Google Maps with Wiseau's face pasted all over it. (There are also numerous typos and strange graphics/images scattered throughout)</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.arngren.net/" title="arngren">arngren.net</a>: This is a bad website because its layout is ugly and crowded. It's styled like the classified section of a newspaper, and doesn't scale to the size of your browser window, such that you have to scroll right and down to see more listings. There is also little to no logical sorting of the listings.</p>
